# Awesome Eval Driven Development (EDD)

Eval-Driven-Development (EDD) is a methodology for guiding the development of LLM-backed apps via a set of task-specific evals (i.e. prompt, context, expected outputs as references).*

These evals guide prompt engineering, model selection, fine-tuning, and so on. We can then run these evals to quickly measure improvements or regressions as the app changes.

It's Test Driven Development (TDD) for LLM-backed apps.
